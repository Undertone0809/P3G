## üöÄ Features

In this [cookiecutter üç™](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template we combine state-of-the-art libraries and best development practices for Python.

### Development features

- Supports `Python 3.7` and higher.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependencies manager. See configuration in [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/pyproject.toml) and [`setup.cfg`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/setup.cfg).
- Faster formatter tool, automatic codestyle with [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) to replace [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort) and [`pyupgrade`](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade).
- Ready-to-use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks with code-formatting.
- Type checks with  [`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff); docstring checks with [`darglint`](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint); security checks with [`safety`](https://github.com/pyupio/safety) and [`bandit`](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit)
- Testing with [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
- Ready-to-use [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.editorconfig), [`.dockerignore`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.dockerignore), and [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.gitignore). You don't have to worry about those things.
- The ability of building docker.

### Deployment features

- `GitHub` integration: issue and pr templates.
- `Github Actions` with predefined [build workflow](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/workflows/build.yml) as the default CI/CD.
- Everything is already set up for security checks, codestyle checks, code formatting, testing, linting, docker builds, etc with [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Makefile#L89). More details in [makefile-usage](#makefile-usage).
- [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker/Dockerfile) for your package.
- Always up-to-date dependencies with [`@dependabot`](https://dependabot.com/). You only need to [enable it](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates#enabling-github-dependabot-version-updates).
- Automatic release notes with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). You may see the list of labels in [`release-drafter.yml`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/release-drafter.yml). Works perfectly with [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

### Open source community features

- Ready-to-use [Pull Requests templates](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and several [Issue templates](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/tree/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE).
- Files such as: `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and `SECURITY.md` are generated automatically.
- [`Stale bot`](https://github.com/apps/stale) that closes abandoned issues after a period of inactivity. (You will only [need to setup free plan](https://github.com/marketplace/stale)). Configuration is [here](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/.github/.stale.yml).
- [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification with [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter).

All input values will be saved in the `cookiecutter-config-file.yml` file so that you won't lose them. üòâ

#### Demo

[![Create a cool Python project structure with p3g](https://zeeland-bucket.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/images/20240519054442.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpKlGRgVp6g "Create a cool Python project structure with p3g")

### More details

Your project will contain `README.md` file with instructions for development, deployment, etc. You can read [the project README.md template](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/tree/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D) before.

### Initial set up

#### Initialize `poetry`

By running `pip install poetry & make install`

After you create a project, it will appear in your directory, and will display [a message about how to initialize the project](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/tree/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D#very-first-steps).

#### Initialize `pre-commit`

`pre-commit` is already installed if you initialize git repo before running `make install`. If it fails without initialization, run `make install` again to install pre-commit to `.git`.

### Package example

Want to know more about Poetry? Check [its documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

<details>
<summary>Details about Poetry</summary>
<p>

Poetry's [commands](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#commands) are very intuitive and easy to learn, like:

- `poetry add numpy@latest`
- `poetry run pytest`
- `poetry publish --build`

etc
</p>
</details>

#### CLI example

If you set `create_example_template` to be `cli` the template comes with a cute little CLI application example. It utilises [`Typer`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) and [`Rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) for CLI input validation and beautiful formatting in the terminal.

After installation via `make install` (preferred) or `poetry install` you can try to play with the example:

```bash
poetry run <project_name> --help
```

```bash
poetry run <project_name> --name Roman
```

### Building and releasing your package

Building a new version of the application contains steps:

- Bump the version of your package `poetry version <version>`. You can pass the new version explicitly, or a rule such as `major`, `minor`, or `patch`. For more details, refer to the [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) standard.
- Make a commit to `GitHub`.
- Create a `GitHub release`.
- And... publish üôÇ `poetry publish --build`

### Makefile usage

[`Makefile`](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/blob/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/Makefile) contains a lot of functions for faster development.

<details>
<summary>1. Install all dependencies and pre-commit hooks</summary>
<p>

Install requirements:

```bash
make install
```

Pre-commit hooks coulb be installed after `git init` via

```bash
make pre-commit-install
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Codestyle and type checks</summary>
<p>

Automatic formatting uses `ruff`.

```bash
make format
```

Codestyle checks only, without rewriting files:

```bash
make check-codestyle
```

> Note: `check-codestyle` uses `ruff` and `darglint` library

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Code security</summary>
<p>

```bash
make check-safety
```

This command launches `Poetry` integrity checks as well as identifies security issues with `Safety` and `Bandit`.

```bash
make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Tests with coverage badges</summary>
<p>

Run `pytest`

```bash
make test
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. All linters</summary>
<p>

Of course there is a command to run all linters in one:

```bash
make lint
```

the same as:

```bash
make check-codestyle && make test && make check-safety
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Docker</summary>
<p>

```bash
make docker-build
```

which is equivalent to:

```bash
make docker-build VERSION=latest
```

Remove docker image with

```bash
make docker-remove
```

More information [about docker](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/tree/main/%7B%7B%20cookiecutter.project_name%20%7D%7D/docker).

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>7. Cleanup</summary>
<p>
Delete pycache files

```bash
make pycache-remove
```

Remove package build

```bash
make build-remove
```

Delete .DS_STORE files

```bash
make dsstore-remove
```

Remove .mypycache

```bash
make mypycache-remove
```

Or to remove all above run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

</p>
</details>

## üéØ What's next

Well, that's up to you üí™üèª. I can only recommend the packages and articles that helped me.

- [`Typer`](https://github.com/tiangolo/typer) is great for creating CLI applications.
- [`Rich`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) makes it easy to add beautiful formatting in the terminal.
- [`Pydantic`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/) ‚Äì data validation and settings management using Python type hinting.
- [`Loguru`](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) makes logging (stupidly) simple.
- [`tqdm`](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) ‚Äì fast, extensible progress bar for Python and CLI.
- [`IceCream`](https://github.com/gruns/icecream) is a little library for sweet and creamy debugging.
- [`orjson`](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) ‚Äì ultra fast JSON parsing library.
- [`Returns`](https://github.com/dry-python/returns) makes you function's output meaningful, typed, and safe!
- [`Hydra`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hydra) is a framework for elegantly configuring complex applications.
- [`FastAPI`](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) is a type-driven asynchronous web framework.

Articles:

- [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/).
- [A handy guide to financial support for open source](https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand)
- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions).
- Maybe you would like to add [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) to commit names. This is really funny. üòÑ

## üìà Releases

You can see the list of available releases on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Undertone0809/python-package-template/releases) page.

We follow [Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) specification.

We use [`Release Drafter`](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter). As pull requests are merged, a draft release is kept up-to-date listing the changes, ready to publish when you're ready. With the categories option, you can categorize pull requests in release notes using labels.

### List of labels and corresponding titles

|               **Label**               |  **Title in Releases**  |
|:-------------------------------------:|:----------------------:|
| `enhancement`, `feature`              | üöÄ Features             |
| `bug`, `refactoring`, `bugfix`, `fix` | üîß Fixes & Refactoring  |
| `build`, `ci`, `testing`              | üì¶ Build System & CI/CD |
| `breaking`                            | üí• Breaking Changes     |

| `dependencies`                        | ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Dependencies updates |

## üß™ TODOs

This template will continue to develop and follow the bleeding edge new tools and best practices to improve the Python development experience.

Here is a list of things that have yet to be implemented:

- Tests coverage reporting ([`Codecov`](https://github.com/marketplace/codecov) ?).
- Auto uploading your package to [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/) when new GitHub release is created.
- Automatic creation and deployment of documentation to GitHub pages. I look at [`MkDocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [Material Design theme](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) and [`mkdocstrings`](https://github.com/pawamoy/mkdocstrings).
- Code metrics with [`Radon`](https://github.com/rubik/radon).
- Docstring coverage with [`interrogate`](https://github.com/econchick/interrogate)
- `Dockerfile` linting with [`dockerfilelint`](https://github.com/replicatedhq/dockerfilelint).
- [Hall of fame](https://github.com/sourcerer-io/hall-of-fame) from `Sourcerer`.
- Some advanced Python linting (?).
- End-to-end testing and validation of the cookiecutter template.
- Add [`Earthly`](https://earthly.dev/)
